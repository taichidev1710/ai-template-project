/**
 * Diagram domain model — framework-agnostic (no React, no AntD).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for the "sơ đồ quan hệ" feature. It
 * generalizes the demo (demo-sdqh) by separating FOUR orthogonal concepts the
 * demo conflated into one `level` field:
 *
 *   1. BlockType      — WHAT a node is (Person, Department, Task). Not ordered.
 *   2. Base relation  — an edge you actually draw & STORE (parent-of, reports-to).
 *   3. Derived relation — computed by composing base hops; NEVER stored (grandparent…).
 *   4. Rank/depth     — a node's position in the hierarchy; DERIVED, never declared.
 *
 * See DESIGN.md in this folder for the full rationale.

 *     Người"; none can say "…but not your own sister", because being someone's
 *     sister is a PATH, not a type.
 *  2. It FORBIDS. ends/chain/same are an OR allow-list, so folding this in with
 *     them would let an edge through the moment it satisfied `same` alone. It
 *     runs separately, as a veto over whatever the allow-list permitted.
 *
 * The relationship is named ONE of two ways, and `when` is the one to reach for:
 *
 *  - `when` NAMES a relation of this same Loại sơ đồ — base (“Cha mẹ – con”, an
 *    edge really there) or derived (“Anh chị em (suy ra)”, a path computed).
 *    This is §7 working as intended: the rule talks about vocabulary the type
 *    declared, so the very thing being banned is also nameable, reusable across
 *    rules, and VISIBLE — toggle it on and the canvas draws who is affected.
 *  - `pattern` spells the hops out inline, for a relationship the catalog has no
 *    name for. The escape hatch, not the default: what it describes cannot be
 *    drawn, cannot be reused, and no one but this rule knows it exists. If the
 *    same path shows up twice, it wanted to be a derived relation.
 *
 * Set both and `when` wins. Set neither and the rule matches nothing.
 *
 * Either way the check runs in BOTH directions, so a symmetric relation cannot
 * slip through by being drawn the other way round.
 *
 * The engine stays domain-neutral: it never learns what a “đời” is, it only asks
 * whether these two are already related that way. Over an org chart the same
 * rule reads “no coordinating with someone under your own manager”.
